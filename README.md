# Weather Map App
An Application that gives you the weather in specific locations
a weather app that uses JavaScript and jQuery to provide forward and reverse geolocation to allow users to track weather with pinpoint coordinate accuracy. 

I used Mapbox API, and Weather API to provide users with various weather metrics presented on Bootstrap card components along with a map.
